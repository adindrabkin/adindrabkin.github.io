  Why Write This Article?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#why-write-this-article">

  </a>
</h1>
<p>The target audience of this blog is people on LinkedIn interested in pursuing a red teaming career at Mandiant.</p>
<p>Preface: I am always happy to connect with folks and talk about the state of the Cybersecurity industry, my work, and how Mandiant / Google Cloud works with our customers. At the same time, I love learning something new about other companies and roles—there seem to be an infinite number of interesting people working on engaging projects, which I want to hear about!</p>
<p>Additional preface: The opinions in this article are my own and not that of my employer.</p>
<p>While I accept the majority of LinkedIn invites I receive, I am perplexed by how few people reach out after connecting. I usually send a message back asking if we have met before, to spark a conversation and hopefully learn something new!</p>
<p>In the last few months, I have been getting, on average, more than one LinkedIn message per week asking an AI-generated variant of the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What does your work look like as a Red Team Consultant at [Mandiant / Google]?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a question I am happy to answer, but I find it very time consuming to reply to all of these messages over LinkedIn—especially when someone&rsquo;s message has been &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; into a three-paragraph, AI-generated, formal request by copy-pasting my LinkedIn header into a generative AI tool.</p>
<p>While the answer to this question may be useful to someone wanting more information on a career in red teaming, I usually find it is sent as an ice breaker instead—no shame in that. When I was a student actively searching for full time roles, I was in a similar position, and can empathize with the effort it takes to cold-message people online.</p>
<p>As a result, I decided to write this short blog to explain what I do, and give some advice on how to reach out. If you are reading this as a college student to be proactive about applying to a role, props to you—the research efforts mean a lot.</p>
<h1 id="answering-the-question">
  Answering the Question
  <a class="heading-link" href="#answering-the-question">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>Our projects are generally measured in weeks for duration. Some projects can be a week long, others can go on for months. In a mid-level individual contributor role, there are few (1-4 hours/week) meetings you are required to attend.</p>
<p>We are expected to have a base-level understanding of all offensive security services offered, and work towards expertise in certain areas. Every consultant is expected to author and deliver a high-quality report following the completion of an engagement. Bonus points if you have the time to update our internal methodologies or processes along the way.</p>
<p>Given the variety of work we perform, it is rare for engagements to feel repetitive until you reach a year of experience. Along those lines, there is rarely a typical day as a consultant—which is why I enjoy the job so much.</p>
<p>The following is a (mostly accurate) breakdown of a week I recently experienced. I had a few days to assist with the social engineering portion of a red team, and spent the remaining time improving our internal methodologies and preparing for upcoming engagements. This may not be as interesting as you, the reader, hopes.</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare C2 infrastructure for an upcoming engagement.</li>
<li>Review reports submitted by more junior consultants.</li>
<li>Make internal updates to our methodologies and coordinate ideas with our sales team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sync with a colleague on updates for a course I will be teaching in a few weeks.</li>
<li>Conduct in-depth research on targets for social engineering.</li>
<li>Research SCCM related attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue researching targets for social engineering.</li>
<li>Successfully voice vish (&ldquo;vish&rdquo;) a target and obtain access to a client&rsquo;s Entra ID employee database.</li>
<li>Begin working on status update documents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Host a kickoff call for an engagement beginning next week.</li>
<li>Continue research for additional social engineering attacks.</li>
<li>Assist with payload development preparations.</li>
<li>Perform administrative tasks related to laptop migrations.</li>
<li>Confirm travel plans for an upcoming engagement; make contingency plans around weather and other unpredictable issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct additional vishing calls which take more time than the average person expects.</li>
<li>Gain persistent access to a client&rsquo;s environment through vishing.</li>
<li>Mentor a new employee on vishing methodology while performing reconnaissance.</li>
<li>Attend our team&rsquo;s weekly meeting to discuss interesting testing results, and tools.</li>
</ul>

  Advice on Reaching Out
  <a class="heading-link" href="#advice-on-reaching-out">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>If you found this blog on your own, I would love to hear about how and why. Regardless, here is some advice on reaching out on LinkedIn to (sometimes) busy red teamers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalize your message beyond a title and role</li>
<li>Remove as much AI fluff as possible</li>
<li>Make it as easy as possible to coordinate a call or video chat</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I prefer a 15-minute phone call when it is for networking or general interest purposes, but understanding messaging may be preferable in certain situations. Reach out, as I would be happy to learn more about your background—like I mentioned earlier, there are so many interesting people doing incredible things, I would enjoy hearing about them as well!</p>
